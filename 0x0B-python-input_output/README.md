# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output
In this project, I practiced file handling in Python. I used the builtin `with`, `open`, and `read` functions with the `json` module to read and write files and serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.
## 0-read_file.py
A function that reads a text file (**`UTF8`**) and prints it to stdout:
* Prototype: `def read_file(filename=""):`
* You must use the with statement
* You donâ€™t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module
