# 0x10. Python - Network #0
In this networking project, I used `curl` in Bash scripts to send various types of HTTP headers. In the process, I learned about how URL's work, domain names, the many different HTTP request/response header fields and status codes, and how to utilize cookies.

Task six was an algorithm challenge separate from the overall project theme completed in Python.

# Requirements
## General
* All your Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (`wc -l file` should print 3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your files must be executable
* The first line of all your bash files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
* All `curl` commands must have the option `-s` (silent mode)
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
* The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
* All your classes should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented:` python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
* A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
