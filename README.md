# _Higher-level programming - Python_

**_A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code._**

# Zen
```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
# Pycodestyle
`Pycodestyle` is now the [new standard of Python style code](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/466)

## WELCOMEü§ù
*This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the alx-Holberton curriculum on Higher level programming.*
## Introduction
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python‚Äôs elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. __*Python*__ consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
# Table of Contents
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX_Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other higher-level programming concepts while working in the `PYTHON` language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:
## 1. 0x00-python-hello_world
Getting started with Python. Formating output and string manipulation.

## 2. 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
Loops and flow control using if...else. Functions in python are also introduced here.

## 3. 0x02-python-import_modules
Python modules enhance code reusability. This project explains how modules are created and used to write python scripts.


## 4. 0x03-python-data_structures
Python supports a number of data structures. These include lists, stacks queues, tuples.

## 5. 0x04-python-more_data_structures
More data structures in python are sets and dictionaries. In built function introduced here include map, filter, lambda anonymous functions.

## 6. 0x05-python-exceptions
An exception is an error detected during execution. Python offers a variety of builtin exceptions and also allows for custom exceptions.

## 7. 0x06-python_classes
Object Oriented Programming is a way of organizing a program such that the data and functionality are put together to make an object. An object is an instance of a class whereby the class defines the layout of te object in terms of the attributes and methods. Python like any other OOP Language, supports the four main concepts of OOP. These are: Data Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

# Compilation Process
The source code in python is saved as a . py file which is then compiled into a format known as byte code, byte code is then converted to machine code. After the compilation, the code is stored in . pyc files and is regenerated when the source is updated.
