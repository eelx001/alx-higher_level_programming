## WELCOME
**This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the alx-Holberton curriculum on Higher level programming.**
## Introduction
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
# Table of Contents
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX_Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other higher-level programming concepts while working in the `PYTHON` language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:
* 0x00. Python - Hello, World
* 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
* 0x02. Python - import & modules
# Compilation Process
The source code in python is saved as a . py file which is then compiled into a format known as byte code, byte code is then converted to machine code. After the compilation, the code is stored in . pyc files and is regenerated when the source is updated.

## Acknowledgements
All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for the ALX-SE programme. **alx_africa** is an online full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning.
## STAY TUNED!
* More projects are coming soon!!!
* I am on my way to be the best software engineer that I can possibly be!!!
