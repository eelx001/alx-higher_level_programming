## 0-positive_or_negative.py
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
* You can find the source code here
* The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
* You don‚Äôt have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
* The output of the program should be:
  * The number, followed by
    * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
    * if the number is 0: is zero
    * if the number is less than 0: is negative
  * followed by a new line
```
