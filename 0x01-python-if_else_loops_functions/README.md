Exploration of control flow, loops and functions in python

* 0-positive_or_negative.py
  * This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time and prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative

* 1-last_digit.py
  * This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

* 2-print_alphabet.py
  * This is a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

* 3-print_alphabt.py
  * This is a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, except q and e ,and not followed by a new line.

* 4-print_hexa.py
  * This is a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal

* 5-print_comb2.py
  * This is a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

* 6-print_comb3.py
  * This is a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

* 7-islower.py
  * This is a function that checks for lowercase character.

* 8-uppercase.py
  * This is a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

* 9-print_last_digit.py
  * This is a function that prints the last digit of a number.

* 10-add.py
  * This is a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

* 11-pow.py
  * This is a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

* 12-fizzbuzz.py
  * This is a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

* 13-insert_number.c
  * Technical interview preparation:
    * A function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

* 100-print_tebahpla.py
  * A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

* 101-remove_char_at.py
  * A function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

* 102-magic_calculation.py
  * The Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
